STT-Clean is a macOS menu-bar app that types what you say into any app, at the cursor. While you
speak, a live draft appears as you talk, transcribed on your Mac by Parakeet or Whisper (MLX on
Apple silicon). When you stop, a local LLM in Ollama or LM Studio refines it: it applies spoken
corrections ("scratch that"), punctuation ("comma", "new line"), your glossary's spellings and
translation ("write it in English"), and the clean text replaces the draft. It is a wrapper
around models you already have: it finds them, lists them in its menu, and never downloads one.
Nothing leaves your Mac. On an M4, Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3 transcribes 44 s of speech in 1.2 s, and
`gemma4:12b-mlx` refines a dictation in 0.6–3.3 s.

| You say | Pasted |
|---|---|
| "Send the report to Luca by Friday, actually no, by Thursday." | Send the report to Luca by Thursday. |
| "Caro Marco virgola a capo ti scrivo per confermare la riunione di domani punto" | Caro Marco,<br>ti scrivo per confermare la riunione di domani. |
| "Ho installato o lama e uso il modello emme elle ics per la dettatura." | Ho installato Ollama e uso il modello MLX per la dettatura. *(glossary)* |
| "Domani mando la relazione al professore. Scrivilo in inglese." | I will send the report to the professor tomorrow. |

*Real outputs of `gemma4:12b-mlx` from `tests/bench_llm.py` and `tests/e2e_pipeline.py`.*

## Install

| You need | Check / get it |
|---|---|
| A Mac with Apple silicon (M1 or newer), macOS 14 or newer | Apple menu → About This Mac |
| Apple's command line tools (for `git` and to build the app) | `xcode-select --install` |
| Python 3.12, 3.13 or 3.14 (3.15 is too new for some dependencies yet) | [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/) or `brew install python@3.14` |

```bash
git clone https://github.com/riccardoroselli/STT-Clean.git
cd STT-Clean
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` creates a Python environment in `.venv` inside the folder (59 packages, 0.7 GB, no
models), builds `build/STT-Clean.app` and opens it. When it finishes it tells you if a speech model
or an LLM is missing, with the command to get one. To use a Python environment you already have
instead of `.venv`: `STT_CLEAN_PYTHON=/path/to/python ./install.sh`.

The app runs from this folder, so keep it where you cloned it. To update: `git pull`, then
`./install.sh` again.

### First launch

1. **Accessibility:** allow it when macOS asks. STT-Clean needs it to type the text.
2. **Microphone:** allow it on your first dictation.
3. **Speech model:** right-click the icon → **Speech**. If the list is empty, download one (next
   section). The new model shows up the next time you open the menu, no restart needed.
4. **Start at login** (optional): System Settings → General → Login Items → + →
   `build/STT-Clean.app`.

## Models

STT-Clean uses the models already on your Mac and checks for new ones every time you open its menu.

| Kind | Found in | Formats | Picked at launch |
|---|---|---|---|
| Speech | The Hugging Face cache: `~/.cache/huggingface/hub`, or `$HF_HOME/hub` if it was set when you ran `install.sh` | Parakeet and Whisper in MLX format (`mlx-community/…`) | Your last pick, else Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3, else the first one found |
| LLM | Every chat model in [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai), while they run | Any instruct model | Your last pick, else `gemma4:12b-mlx`, else the first one found |

Download a speech model with the Hugging Face CLI that `install.sh` put in `.venv`:

```bash
.venv/bin/hf download mlx-community/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3      # 2.3 GB, 25 European languages, fastest
.venv/bin/hf download mlx-community/whisper-large-v3-turbo    # 1.6 GB, ~100 languages
```

Whisper models in other formats are not found: whisper.cpp or MacWhisper `.bin` files,
faster-whisper, OpenAI `.pt` files, Transformers `openai/whisper-*`. Whisper pads every clip to
30 s, so with large Whisper models the live draft updates less often than with Parakeet.

The LLM is optional; without one you get the raw transcript. For the refinement, install Ollama and
run `ollama pull gemma4:12b-mlx` (7.7 GB, ~8 GB of RAM while loaded), or download a model in LM
Studio. The prompt was tuned on Gemma 4: `gemma4:12b-mlx` passes all 16 cases of
`tests/bench_llm.py`; run it to check another model. Models that answer the text instead of
refining it fail the check run when you pick them, and the previous model stays.

## Usage

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Dictate | Click the menu-bar icon, speak, click again. A clock shows the recording time. |
| Cancel | Esc while recording: the live text is erased, nothing is pasted. |
| Menu | Right-click the icon. |
| Switch speech model or LLM | Menu → **Speech** or **LLM** → click a model. The one in use is ticked. |
| Smart clean-up (LLM) | Menu switch. Off: raw transcript, and the LLM's memory is freed. |
| Live text while speaking | Menu switch. Off: only the final text is typed. |
| Custom spellings | Menu → **Edit Glossary…** (see [Glossary](#glossary)) |

Your choices are remembered. Only one LLM is in memory at a time; it is unloaded when you switch,
turn clean-up off or quit.

Keystrokes only go to the app, window and text field where the dictation started. Switch away and
the typing pauses; come back and it catches up. If you're still away when the dictation ends, the
text goes to the clipboard and the menu says so.

### Voice commands

The LLM follows these in Italian and English:

| Kind | Say | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Self-correction | "scratch that" · "actually no" · "no cancella" · "anzi" | Only the corrected version is kept |
| Punctuation | "comma", "period" · "virgola", "punto", "due punti", "punto interrogativo" | `,` `.` `:` `?` |
| Layout | "new line" / "a capo" · "new paragraph" / "nuovo paragrafo" | Line break / blank line |
| Translation | "… write it in English" · "scrivilo in inglese" · "traduci in inglese" | Whole text translated, instruction removed |
| Partial translation | "solo la prossima frase traducimela in inglese" | Only the next sentence translated |

Questions and requests are pasted as text, not answered.

### Glossary

For names, brands and jargon the speech model gets wrong, open Menu → **Edit Glossary…** and add one
term per line:

```
Ollama: o lama, olama
GitHub: git hub
Kubernetes
```

The variants after the colon are replaced exactly, before the LLM runs. Every term is also given to
the LLM, which fixes close mis-hearings from context. Changes apply from the next dictation.

## How it works

| Step | What happens | Code |
|---|---|---|
| Record | The mic opens on click and closes on stop. Esc is a global hot key only while recording. | `src/menubar.py`, `src/audio.py`, `src/esc_key.py` |
| Live draft | Every ≥0.5 s the whole clip so far is transcribed again. Only words that two consecutive drafts agree on are typed, so the text grows instead of flickering. | `src/stt.py`, `src/live.py` |
| Final pass | The clip is transcribed once more and the glossary's variants are replaced. | `src/stt_clean.py`, `src/cleanup.py` |
| Refinement | The LLM (temperature 0, thinking off) applies the voice commands. On any failure, or an output that looks like an answer, the raw text is used. | `src/cleanup.py` |
| Replace | Only the changed tail of the draft is erased; the rest is pasted with ⌘V. The previous clipboard (text, images, files) is restored once the app has read the paste. | `src/output.py` |

With Parakeet, transcribing the whole clip again takes ~0.25 s at 10 s of audio, ~0.5 s at 30–40 s
and ~0.9 s at 50 s. Parakeet uses ~1.3 GB of RAM; its working cache is freed after each dictation.

`build/STT-Clean.app` is a small compiled launcher (`macos/launcher.c`) that starts the Python app
as a child process, so macOS gives the Microphone and Accessibility permissions to STT-Clean
rather than to Python.

## Privacy

| | |
|---|---|
| **Network** | Only `127.0.0.1`: Ollama (port 11434) and LM Studio (port 1234). The Hugging Face library runs offline (`HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`), so no model is ever downloaded by the app. |
| **Your voice** | Kept in memory during the dictation, never written to disk (unless you run it from a terminal with `--debug`, see [Development](#development)). |
| **Dictated text** | Typed or pasted into your app, shown in the menu's status line, never written to disk. The clipboard is used for the paste and then restored. |
| **Files it writes** | Menu choices: `~/Library/Preferences/com.riccardoroselli.stt-clean.plist`. Glossary: `config/glossary.txt`. Log of the current run (status and errors, no dictated text): `logs/stt-clean.log`, overwritten at each launch. |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| `install.sh`: "Needs Python 3.12, 3.13 or 3.14" | Install Python 3.14 (see [Install](#install)) and run `./install.sh` again. |
| The live text or the final text never appears | Turn STT-Clean on in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility. The menu's status line warns about this. |
| The app does nothing when opened, and the project is on an external drive | Allow STT-Clean in Privacy & Security → Files & Folders → Removable Volumes. |
| "No speech model found" | Download one ([Models](#models)), then pick it in the menu → Speech. |
| "Ollama isn't running" | Open Ollama (or LM Studio), or turn Smart clean-up off. |
| A model "didn't work" | It answered instead of refining, or thought too long. Pick another; `gemma4:12b-mlx` passes all checks. |
| Anything else | Read `logs/stt-clean.log`. |

Every `./install.sh` rebuilds the app, and macOS identifies an unsigned app by its exact contents:
allow Accessibility and the Microphone again after an update.

**Reset or uninstall.** `defaults delete com.riccardoroselli.stt-clean` clears the menu choices.
To uninstall, run it, remove STT-Clean from Login Items if you added it, and delete the folder. Your
models stay where they are.

## Limitations

- Dictation starts and stops with a mouse click; there is no keyboard shortcut, and Esc only cancels.
- Secure input fields (passwords, terminals with Secure Keyboard Entry) block typing and pasting.
- Chrome and Electron apps (VS Code) don't report their focused text field, so switching tabs inside
  one of their windows during a dictation isn't detected.
- A clipboard manager that reads the clipboard before the target app counts as the paste, so the
  old clipboard can come back too early.
- The LLM rewrites the whole text: long dictations take ~1 s per 20–25 words. Turn Smart clean-up off
  for raw speed.
- Voice commands work as phrased in the prompt (`SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `src/cleanup.py`); there is no
  general voice-command engine.

## Project structure

```
install.sh             One-step install: Python packages in .venv, then the app
src/                   The app (Python, ~1180 lines)
  stt_clean.py         Entry point and worker loop: record → live draft → final → refine → paste
  stt.py               Speech engines (Parakeet, Whisper on MLX); finds the models on this Mac
  menubar.py           Menu-bar icon, menu, Speech/LLM lists, switches, saved choices, status line
  audio.py             Mic stream opened per recording, resampling, sounds
  live.py              Live-draft logic: which words to type, minimal erase/append diff
  output.py            Keystrokes, focus check (app/window/field), clipboard save/restore, ⌘V
  esc_key.py           Esc as a global hot key while recording (no extra permission)
  cleanup.py           LLM client (Ollama, LM Studio), system prompt, glossary, fallbacks
  requirements.txt     Pinned dependencies

macos/                 App bundle: build_app.sh, launcher.c, Info.plist, AppIcon.icns, make_icon.py
tests/                 31 unit tests, LLM benchmark, end-to-end and typing checks
assets/                Logo and 1024 px app icon
```

`.venv/`, `build/`, `logs/` and your `config/glossary.txt` are created locally and not tracked.

## Development

```bash
.venv/bin/python src/stt_clean.py --no-paste    # run from a terminal: log there, text printed, not typed
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover tests     # 31 unit tests: live-draft logic, glossary, LLM servers, engines, settings
.venv/bin/python tests/bench_llm.py [model ...] # 16 dictations through the LLM picked in the menu, exit 1 on a failure
.venv/bin/python tests/e2e_pipeline.py          # macOS `say` → speech model → LLM, no mic
.venv/bin/python tests/typing_check.py          # replays heavy live-draft churn into TextEdit (takes the keyboard ~15 s)
```

`--debug` keeps the last dictation's audio and live drafts in `logs/debug/` to replay it offline.
After changing `SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `src/cleanup.py`, rerun `tests/bench_llm.py`.
